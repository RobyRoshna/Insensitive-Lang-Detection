Pattern recognition and synthesis for sign language translation system,10.1145/191028.191030,"Sign language is one means of communication for hearing-impaired people. Words and sentences in sign language are mainly represented by hands' gestures. In this report, we show a sign language translation system which we are developing. The system translates Japanese sign language into Japanese and vice versa. In this system, hand shape and position data are inputted using DataGlove. Inputted hand motions are recognized and translated into Japanese sentences. Japanese text is translated into sign language represented as 3-D computer-graphic animation of sign language gestures.","{'series': ""Assets '94"", 'location': 'Marina Del Rey, California, USA', 'numpages': '8', 'pages': '1–8', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the First Annual ACM Conference on Assistive Technologies', 'abstract': ""Sign language is one means of communication for hearing-impaired people.

Multimedia dictionary of American Sign Language,10.1145/191028.191031,"The Multimedia Dictionary of American Sign Language (MM-DASL) is a Macintosh application designed to function as a bilingual (ASL-English) dictionary.

A system for teaching speech to profoundly deaf children using synthesized acoustic and articulatory patterns,10.1145/191028.191032,"This paper describes a computer assisted method of teaching profoundly deaf children to speak, which employs the unique feature of an integrated text-to-speech system (TTS).

In that system, teacher's speech is input to the system and used as a model for the children to follow, and the children's speech is monitored to provide feedback. As with other computer-aided speech training systems (e.g. [2]), the teacher-assisted trainer is limited by the time students have with speech teachers.

The system is responsible for adding proper function words (e.g., articles, prepositions) and necessary morphological endings.

Validation of a keystroke-level model for a text entry system used by people with disabilities,10.1145/191028.191061,"A keystroke-level model of user performance was developed to predict the improvement in text generation rate with a word prediction system relative to letters-only typing.

An experimental sound-based hierarchical menu navigation system for visually handicapped use of graphical user interfaces,10.1145/191028.191063,"The use of modern computers by the visually handicapped has become more difficult over the past few years. In earlier systems the user interface was a simple character based environment. In those systems, simple devices like screen readers, braille output and speech synthesizers were effective.

EEG as a means of communication: preliminary experiments in EEG analysis using neural networks,10.1145/191028.191071,"EEG analysis has played a key role in the modeling of the brain's cortical dynamics, but relatively little effort has been devoted to developing EEG as a limited means of communication. If several mental states can be reliably distinguished by recognizing patterns in EEG, then a paralyzed person could communicate to a device like a wheelchair by composing sequences of these mental states. EEG pattern recognition is a difficult problem and hinges on the success of finding representations of the EEG signals in which the patterns can be distinguished. In this article, we report on a study comparing three EEG representations, the raw signals, a reduced-dimensional representation using the K-L transform, and a frequency-based representation. Classification is performed with a two-layer  neural network implemented on a CNAPS server (128 processor, SIMD architecture) by Adaptive Solutions, Inc..

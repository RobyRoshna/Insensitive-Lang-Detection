Faster Text-to-Speeches: Enhancing Blind People's Information Scanning with Faster Concurrent Speech,10.1145/2700648.2809840,"Blind people rely mostly on the auditory feedback of screen readers to consume digital information. Still, how fast can information be processed remains a major problem. The use of faster speech rates is one of the main techniques to speed-up the consumption of digital information. Moreover, recent experiments have suggested the use of concurrent speech as a valid alternative when scanning for relevant information. In this paper, we present an experiment with 30 visually impaired participants, where we compare the use of faster speech rates against the use of concurrent speech. Moreover, we combine these two approaches by gradually increasing the speech rate with one, two and three voices. Results show that concurrent voices with speech rates slightly faster than the default rate, enable a significantly faster scanning for relevant content, while maintaining its comprehension. In contrast, to keep-up with concurrent speech timings, One-Voice requires larger speech rate increments, which cause a considerable loss in performance. Overall, results suggest that the best compromise between efficiency and the ability to understand each sentence is the use of Two-Voices with a rate of 1.75*default-rate (approximately 278 WPM).","{'series': ""ASSETS '15"", 'location': 'Lisbon, Portugal', 'keywords': 'auditory perception, blind, cocktail party effect, concurrent speech, scanning, screen reader, skimming, speech rate, text-to-speech, visually impaired', 'numpages': '9', 'pages': '3–11', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers \\&amp; Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Blind people rely mostly on the auditory feedback of screen readers to consume digital information.

Towards Large Scale Evaluation of Novel Sonification Techniques for Non Visual Shape Exploration,10.1145/2700648.2809848,"There are several situations in which a person with visual impairment or blindness needs to extract information from an image. Examples include everyday activities, like reading a map, as well as educational activities, like exercises to develop visuospatial skills. In this contribution we propose a set of 6 sonification techniques to recognize simple shapes on touchscreen devices. The effectiveness of these sonification techniques is evaluated though Invisible Puzzle, a mobile application that makes it possible to conduct non-supervised evaluation sessions. Invisible Puzzle adopts a gamification approach and is a preliminary step in the development of a complete game that will make it possible to conduct a large scale evaluation with hundreds or thousands of blind users. With Invisible Puzzle we conducted 131 tests with sighted subjects and 18 tests with subjects with blindness. All subjects involved in the process successfully completed the evaluation session, with high engagement, hence showing the effectiveness of the evaluation procedure. Results give interesting insights on the differences among the sonification techniques and, most importantly, show that, after a short training, subjects are able to identify many different shapes.","{'series': ""ASSETS '15"", 'location': 'Lisbon, Portugal', 'keywords': 'accessibility, gamification, image recognition, remote evaluation, sonification, touch-screen devices, visual impairment or blindness', 'numpages': '9', 'pages': '13–21', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers \\&amp; Accessibility', 'abstract': 'There are several situations in which a person with visual impairment or blindness needs to extract information from an image.

Getting Smartphones to Talkback: Understanding the Smartphone Adoption Process of Blind Users,10.1145/2700648.2809842,"The advent of system-wide accessibility services on mainstream touch-based smartphones has been a major point of inclusion for blind and visually impaired people. Ever since, researchers aimed to improve the accessibility of specific tasks, such text-entry and gestural interaction. However, little work aimed to understand and improve the overall accessibility of these devices in real world settings. In this paper, we present an eight-week long study with five novice blind participants where we seek to understand major concerns, expectations, challenges, barriers, and experiences with smartphones. The study included pre-adoption and weekly interviews, weekly controlled task assessments, and in-the wild system-wide usage. Our results show that mastering these devices is an arduous and long task, confirming the users' initial concerns. We report on accessibility barriers experienced throughout the study, which could not be encountered in task-based laboratorial settings.

A Unifying Notification System To Scale Up Assistive Services,10.1145/2700648.2809855,"Aging creates needs for assistive technology to support all activities of daily living (meal preparation, dressing, social participation, stove monitoring, etc.). These needs are mostly addressed by a silo-based approach that requires a new assistive service (e.g., a reminder system, a pill prompter) to be acquired for every activity to be supported. In practice, these services manifest their silo-based nature in their user interactions, and more specifically, in the heterogeneity of their notification system. This heterogeneity incurs a cognitive cost that prevents scaling up assistive services and compromises adoption by older adults. This paper presents an approach to scaling up the combination of technology-based, assistive services by proposing a unifying notification system. To do so, (1) we propose a decomposition of assistive services to expose their needs in notification; (2) we introduce a notification framework, allowing heterogeneous assistive services to homogeneously notify users; (3) we present how this notification framework is carried out in practice for an assisted living platform.We successfully applied our approach to a range of existing and new assistive services. We used our notification framework to implement an assistive platform that combines a variety of assistive services. This platform has been deployed and used 24/7 at the home of 15 older adults for up to 6 months. This study provides empirical evidence of the effectiveness and learnability of the notification system of our platform, irrespective of the cognitive and sensory resources of the user. Additional results show that our assisted living platform achieved high user acceptance and satisfaction.","{'series': ""ASSETS '15"", 'location': 'Lisbon, Portugal', 'keywords': 'field study, human factors, measurement, notification systems, performance', 'numpages': '11', 'pages': '77–87', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers \\&amp; Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Aging creates needs for assistive technology to support all activities of daily living (meal preparation, dressing, social participation, stove monitoring, etc.).

Disability and Technology: A Critical Realist Perspective,10.1145/2700648.2809851,"Assistive technology (AT) as a field explores the design, use and evaluation of computing technology that aims to benefit people with disabilities. The majority of the work consequently takes the functional needs of people with disabilities as starting point and matches those with technological opportunity spaces. With this paper, we argue that the underlying philosophical position implied in this approach can be seen as reductionist as the disabled experience is arguably richer and often more complex as can be projected from the functional limitations of people. Thinkers and activists in Disability Studies have conceptualised disability in various ways and more recently, critical realism was proposed as a philosophical position through which the many different facets of the disabled experience could be incorporated. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using a critical realist perspective to guide designers in developing technology for people with disabilities and thereby aim to contribute to the philosophical underpinnings of AT. After a brief review of historical conceptualisations of disability, we introduce the critical realist argument and discuss its appeal for understanding disability and the possible roles technology can have in this context.

How 3D Virtual Humans Built by Adolescents with ASD Affect Their 3D Interactions,10.1145/2700648.2809863,"Training games have many potential benefits for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) intervention, such as increasing motivation and improving the abilities of performing daily living activities, due to their ability to simulate real world scenarios.

Incorporating users' interests into the game could be a good way to build a motivating game, especially for users with ASD. We propose a Customizable Virtual Human (CVH) which enables users with ASD to easily customize a virtual human and then interact with the CVH in a 3D interaction task.

Using In-Situ Projection to Support Cognitively Impaired Workers at the Workplace,10.1145/2700648.2809853,"Today's working society tries to integrate more and more impaired workers into everyday working processes. One major scenario for integrating impaired workers is in the assembly of products. However, the tasks that are being assigned to cognitively impaired workers are easy tasks that consist of only a small number of assembly steps. For tasks with a higher number of steps, cognitively impaired workers need instructions to help them with assembly. Although supervisors provide general support and assist new workers while learning new assembly steps, sheltered work organizations often provide additional printed pictorial instructions that actively guide the workers. To further improve continuous instructions, we built a system that uses in-situ projection and a depth camera to provide context-sensitive instructions. To explore the effects of in-situ instructions, we compared them to state-of-the-art pictorial instructions in a user study with 15 cognitively impaired workers at a sheltered work organization. The results show that using in-situ instructions, cognitively impaired workers can assemble more complex products up to 3 times faster and with up to 50\% less errors. Further, the workers liked the in-situ instructions provided by our assistive system and would use it for everyday assembly.","{'series': ""ASSETS '15"", 'location': 'Lisbon, Portugal', 'keywords': 'assistance for impaired workers, assistive system, augmented reality, in-situ projection', 'numpages': '8', 'pages': '185–192', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 17th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers \\&amp; Accessibility', 'abstract': ""Today's working society tries to integrate more and more impaired workers into everyday working processes.

Most SD systems utilize a trained typist to transcribe the speech into text (speech-to-text) onto a display. Still, these students encounter significant but subtle barriers in following speech-to-text displays, especially when detailed visuals are used or when the speaker is fast or uses uncommon words. Hearing students can simultaneously watch the visuals and listen to the spoken explanation, while DHH students constantly look away from the SD to search and observe details in the classroom visuals. As a result, they spend less time watching the visuals and gain less information than their hearing peers. They can also fall behind in reading the speech-text.We discuss the implementation and evaluation of a real-time Tracked Speech-To-Text Display (TSD), that addresses these subtle barriers presented by SD systems. The TSD system minimizes the student's viewing distance between the Speech-to-Text Display and the speaker.

"Typing Performance of Blind Users: An Analysis of Touch Behaviors, Learning Effect, and In-Situ Usage",10.1145/2700648.2809861,"Non-visual text-entry for people with visual impairments has focused mostly on the comparison of input techniques reporting on performance measures, such as accuracy and speed. While researchers have been able to establish that non-visual input is slow and error prone, there is little understanding on how to improve it. To develop a richer characterization of typing performance, we conducted a longitudinal study with five novice blind users. For eight weeks, we collected in-situ usage data and conducted weekly laboratory assessment sessions. This paper presents a thorough analysis of typing performance that goes beyond traditional aggregated measures of text-entry and reports on character-level errors and touch measures. Our findings show that users improve over time, even though it is at a slow rate (0.3 WPM per week). Substitutions are the most common type of error and have a significant impact on entry rates. In addition to text input data, we analyzed touch behaviors, looking at touch contact points, exploration movements, and lift positions.

Designing Kinect2Scratch Games to Help Therapists Train Young Adults with Cerebral Palsy in Special Education School Settings,10.1145/2700648.2811356,"Children with cerebral palsy (CP) may need to undergo long-term physical rehabilitation to enhance neural development. Currently, commercial rehabilitation products cannot be customized easily and are expensive; consequently, public special-education schools generally cannot afford purchasing these products. This study employs the Microsoft Kinect technology and image recognition technology to create a rehabilitation system which may be applicable for people with CP. To motivate people with CP to engage in exercise training, we gamified the movement training of self-feeding and self-dressing for young adults with CP in special education school settings.

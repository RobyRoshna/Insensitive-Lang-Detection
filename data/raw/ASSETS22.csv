VRBubble: Enhancing Peripheral Awareness of Avatars for People with Visual Impairments in Social Virtual Reality,10.1145/3517428.3544821,"Social Virtual Reality (VR) is growing for remote socialization and collaboration. However, current social VR applications are not accessible to people with visual impairments (PVI) due to their focus on visual experiences. We aim to facilitate social VR accessibility by enhancing PVI’s peripheral awareness of surrounding avatar dynamics. We designed VRBubble, an audio-based VR technique that provides surrounding avatar information based on social distances. Based on Hall’s proxemic theory, VRBubble divides the social space with three Bubbles—Intimate, Conversation, and Social Bubble—generating spatial audio feedback to distinguish avatars in different bubbles and provide suitable avatar information. We provide three audio alternatives: earcons, verbal notifications, and real-world sound effects. PVI can select and combine their preferred feedback alternatives for different avatars, bubbles, and social contexts. We evaluated VRBubble and an audio beacon baseline with 12 PVI in a navigation and a conversation context. We found that VRBubble significantly enhanced participants’ avatar awareness during navigation and enabled avatar identification in both contexts. However, VRBubble was shown to be more distracting in crowded environments.","{'series': ""ASSETS '22"", 'location': 'Athens, Greece', 'keywords': 'audio feedback, proxemics, social virtual reality, visual impairments', 'numpages': '17', 'articleno': '3', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Social Virtual Reality (VR) is growing for remote socialization and collaboration.

Hasty adaptations make it unclear how to design these programs to capture the benefits of online delivery and face-to-face interactions. To understand the complexities of program delivery, we interviewed program coordinators and held focus groups with people living with dementia (PLWD) and their informal carers. We applied an interdependence framework to examine how the relationships between individuals affect program benefits. We found that interdependencies within an organization related to finances and networking are key and that organizational and individual interdependencies converge during program delivery. Our findings suggest these two interdependencies could influence one another more effectively if technology, like video conferencing, were designed to account for it.

LaMPost: Design and Evaluation of an AI-assisted Email Writing Prototype for Adults with Dyslexia,10.1145/3517428.3544819,"Prior work has explored the writing challenges experienced by people with dyslexia, and the potential for new spelling, grammar, and word retrieval technologies to address these challenges. However, the capabilities for natural language generation demonstrated by the latest class of large language models (LLMs) highlight an opportunity to explore new forms of human-AI writing support tools. In this paper, we introduce LaMPost, a prototype email-writing interface that explores the potential for LLMs to power writing support tools that address the varied needs of people with dyslexia. LaMPost draws from our understanding of these needs and introduces novel AI-powered features for email-writing, including: outlining main ideas, generating a subject line, suggesting changes, rewriting a selection. We evaluated LaMPost with 19 adults with dyslexia, identifying many promising routes for further exploration (including the popularity of the “rewrite” and “subject line” features), but also finding that the current generation of LLMs may not surpass the accuracy and quality thresholds required to meet the needs of writers with dyslexia. Surprisingly, we found that participants’ awareness of the AI had no effect on their perception of the system, nor on their feelings of autonomy, expression, and self-efficacy when writing emails.

Quantifying Touch: New Metrics for Characterizing What Happens During a Touch,10.1145/3517428.3544804,"Measures of human performance for touch-based systems have focused mainly on overall metrics like touch accuracy and target acquisition speed. But touches are not atomic—they unfold over time and space, especially for users with limited fine motor function, for whom it can be difficult to perform quick, accurate touches. To gain insight into what happens during a touch, we offer 15 target-agnostic touch metrics, most of which have not been mathematically formalized in the literature. They are touch direction, variability, drift, duration, extent, absolute/signed area change, area variability, area deviation, area extent, absolute/signed angle change, angle variability, angle deviation, and angle extent. These metrics regard a touch as a time series of ovals instead of a mere (x, y) coordinate. We provide mathematical definitions and visual depictions of our metrics, and consider policies for calculating our metrics when multiple fingers perform coincident touches. To exercise our metrics, we collected touch data from 27 participants, 15 of whom reported having limited fine motor function.

Creating 3D Printed Assistive Technology Through Design Shortcuts: Leveraging Digital Fabrication Services to Incorporate 3D Printing into the Physical Therapy Classroom: Leveraging Digital Fabrication Services to Incorporate 3D Printing into the Physical Therapy Classroom,10.1145/3517428.3544816,"Digital fabrication methods have been shown to be an effective method for producing customized assistive technology (AT). However, the skills required to utilize these tools currently require a high level of technical skill.

We worked to address these issues by introducing a group of PT students to maker concepts and having them develop custom AT for real end users with the help of makers.

However, the specific features of a graphic or aspects that enable object (3D) recognition through them need investigation.

As a part of this workshop, we plan to draft a white paper that discusses the learning objectives and their relative priorities that were derived in the workshop.","{'series': ""ASSETS '22"", 'location': 'Athens, Greece', 'keywords': 'Accessibility, computer science education, curriculum', 'numpages': '5', 'articleno': '104', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Accessibility is an important skillset for computing graduates, however it is commonly not included in computing curriculums.

Multidisciplinary Perspectives on Designing Accessible Systems for Users with Multiple Impairments: Grand Challenges and Opportunities for Future Research,10.1145/3517428.3550405,"Historically, the accessibility community has focused on designing assistive technologies and systems related to single categories of impairments. While this approach is justifiable and contributes to the advancement of the field, many researchers argue that designing technologies for one impairment at a time contributes to an oversimplification of disability and does not reflect real-world experiences of a significant number of users who live with multiple impairments. How can the accessibility field leverage theories and concepts from other disciplines (e.g. disability studies, medical humanities, social work, engineering, education) to support more appropriate and inclusive technologies for users with complex needs? How can future assistive technologies take into consideration a diverse combination of sensory, cognitive, and physical characteristics? In this workshop, we invite researchers and practitioners from different disciplines to share their perspectives related to challenges and opportunities in designing accessible systems that consider the multidimensional and often complex needs of users living with multiple impairments.","{'series': ""ASSETS '22"", 'location': 'Athens, Greece', 'keywords': 'Accessibility, Assistive Technologies, Disability Studies, Multiple Impairments', 'numpages': '6', 'articleno': '105', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Historically, the accessibility community has focused on designing assistive technologies and systems related to single categories of impairments.

Designing with and for People with Intellectual Disabilities,10.1145/3517428.3550406,"People with intellectual disabilities often experience inequalities that affect the standard of their everyday lives. Assistive technologies can help alleviate some of these inequalities, yet abandonment rates remain high. This is in part due to a lack of involvement of all stakeholders in their design and evaluation, thus resulting in outputs that do not meet this cohort’s complex and heterogeneous needs. The aim of this half-day workshop is to focus on community building in a field that is relatively thin and disjointed, thereby enabling researchers to share experiences on how to design for and with people with intellectual disabilities, provide internal support, and establish new collaborations. Workshop outcomes will help to fill a gap in the available guidelines on how to include people with intellectual disabilities in research, through more accessible protocols as well as personalised and better fit-for-purpose technologies.","{'series': ""ASSETS '22"", 'location': 'Athens, Greece', 'keywords': 'Assessment, Communication, Design, Methods, People with Intellectual Disabilities', 'numpages': '6', 'articleno': '106', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 24th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'People with intellectual disabilities often experience inequalities that affect the standard of their everyday lives.

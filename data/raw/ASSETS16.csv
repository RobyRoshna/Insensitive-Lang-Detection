Accessibility is Becoming Mainstream,10.1145/2982142.2982180,"Since 1976, when California State University Northridge (CSUN) began its Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference, there have been specialized conferences with an accessibility theme. The first ACM ASSETS Conference was held in 1994 when 22 papers were presented. The Rehabilitation Engineering and Assistive Technology Society of North America (RESNA) began its conference in 1979. The first biennial International Conference on Computers Helping People with Special Needs (under a different name) was held in 1988. Accessibility focused journals have existed since at least 1986. This history demonstrates that accessibility has grown into a separate field in research and practice. While this is true, more and more, accessibility has become mainstream.The mainstreaming of accessibility can be seen in its integration into academic computing departments, HCI conferences, and conferences in supporting fields such as computer vision and natural language processing. Most importantly, accessibility can be seen in products and services provided by mainstream industry. One early example of this is the standardization of closed captioning for television. We now have built-in screen readers for iOS and Android devices and Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices are being supplemented by lower cost AAC apps on mainstream touchscreen tablets. Technologies like video chat, personal texting, speech recognition, optical character recognition, and speech synthesis have their roots in solving accessibility problems. Slowly, accessibility is moving into the academic curriculum in computing departments [1]. Web design and development courses are starting to cover accessibility in the WCAG 2.0 and ARIA standards. There are capstone courses that focus on accessibility at several universities.There will always be a need for specialized accessibility related devices and services, but moving forward accessibility will be provided by mainstream companies and accessibility solutions will become valuable to everyone, disabled or not. Mainstream technology companies are asking for more people with disabilities to join their diverse workforces.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'disability, accessibility', 'numpages': '1', 'pages': '1', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Since 1976, when California State University Northridge (CSUN) began its Annual International Technology and Persons with Disabilities Conference, there have been specialized conferences with an accessibility theme.

A Personalizable Mobile Sound Detector App Design for Deaf and Hard-of-Hearing Users,10.1145/2982142.2982171,"Sounds provide informative signals about the world around us. In situations where non-auditory cues are inaccessible, it can be useful for deaf and hard-of-hearing people to be notified about sounds. Through a survey, we explored which sounds are of interest to deaf and hard-of-hearing people, and which means of notification are appropriate. Motivated by these findings, we designed a mobile phone app that alerts deaf and hard-of-hearing people to sounds they care about. The app uses training examples of personally relevant sounds recorded by the user to learn a model of those sounds. It then screens the incoming audio stream from the phone's microphone for those sounds. When it detects a sound, it alerts the user by vibrating and providing a pop-up notification. To evaluate the interface design independent of sound detection errors, we ran a Wizard-of-Oz user study, and found that the app design successfully facilitated deaf and hard-of-hearing users recording training examples. We also explored the viability of a basic machine learning algorithm for sound detection.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'sound detection, hard-of-hearing, deaf, accessibility', 'numpages': '11', 'pages': '3â€“13', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': ""Sounds provide informative signals about the world around us.

Improving Real-Time Captioning Experiences for Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students,10.1145/2982142.2982164,"We take a qualitative approach to understanding deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students' experiences with real-time captioning as an access technology in mainstream university classrooms. We consider both existing human-based captioning as well as new machine-based solutions that use automatic speech recognition (ASR). We employed a variety of qualitative research methods to gather data about students' captioning experiences including in-class observations, interviews, diary studies, and usability evaluations. We also conducted a co-design workshop with 8 stakeholders after our initial research findings. Our results show that accuracy and reliability of the technology are still the most important issues across captioning solutions. However, we additionally found that current captioning solutions tend to limit students' autonomy in the classroom and present a variety of user experience shortcomings, such as complex setups, poor feedback and limited control over caption presentation.

SlidePacer: A Presentation Delivery Tool for Instructors of Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students,10.1145/2982142.2982177,"Following multimedia lectures in mainstream classrooms is challenging for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) students, even when provided with accessibility services. Due to multiple visual sources of information (e.g. teacher, slides, interpreter), these students struggle to divide their attention among several simultaneous sources, which may result in missing important parts of the lecture; as a result, access to information is limited in comparison to their hearing peers, having a negative effect in their academic achievements. In this paper we propose a novel approach to improve classroom accessibility, which focuses on improving the delivery of multimedia lectures. We introduce SlidePacer, a tool that promotes coordination between instructors and sign language interpreters, creating a single instructional unit and synchronizing verbal and visual information sources. We conducted a user study with 60 participants on the effects of SlidePacer in terms of learning performance and gaze behaviors. Results show that SlidePacer is effective in providing increased access to multimedia information; however, we did not find significant improvements in learning performance.

LucentMaps: 3D Printed Audiovisual Tactile Maps for Blind and Visually Impaired People,10.1145/2982142.2982163,"Tactile maps support blind and visually impaired people in orientation and to familiarize with unfamiliar environments. Interactive approaches complement these maps with auditory feedback. However, commonly these approaches focus on blind people. We present an approach which incorporates visually impaired people by visually augmenting relevant parts of tactile maps. These audiovisual tactile maps can be used in conjunction with common tablet computers and smartphones. By integrating conductive elements into 3D printed tactile maps, they can be recognized by a single touch on the mobile device's display, which eases the handling for blind and visually impaired people.

Tactile Accessibility: Does Anyone Need a Haptic Glove?,10.1145/2982142.2982175,"Graphical user interfaces (GUIs) are widely used on smartphones, tablets, and laptops. While GUIs are convenient for sighted users, their accessibility for blind people, who use screen readers to interact with GUIs, remains to be problematic. Even the most screen-reader accessible GUIs are far less usable for blind people compared to sighted people, because the former group cannot benefit from the geometric layout of GUIs. As a result, blind people often have to listen through a lot of irrelevant content before they find what they are looking for. Haptic interfaces (those providing tactile feedback) have the potential to make GUI interfaces more accessible and usable for blind people. Alas, mainstream computer devices do not have haptic screens that would enable high-resolution tactile feedback, and specialized haptic devices are very limited and/or are exuberantly expensive and bulky.  In this paper, we describe a low-cost haptic-glove system, FeelX, which can potentially enable usable tactile interaction with GUIs. The vision of FeelX is to enable blind users to connect it to any computer or smartphone, and then interact with it by moving their hands on any flat surface such as the desk or table. To establish the practicality and the desirability of using haptic gloves, we evaluated the initial prototype of the glove in a user study with 20 blind participants. Throughout the study, we performed a comparative evaluation of several design options for the tactile interface. The participants were asked to identify simple geometric figures such as lines, rectangles, circles, and triangles that are the basic building blocks of any GUI interface.

How People with Low Vision Access Computing Devices: Understanding Challenges and Opportunities,10.1145/2982142.2982168,"Low vision is a pervasive condition in which people have difficulty seeing even with corrective lenses.

Real-Time Mobile Personalized Simulations of Impaired Colour Vision,10.1145/2982142.2982170,"Colour forms an essential element of day-to-day life for most people, but at least 5\% of the world have Impaired Colour Vision (ICV) - seeing fewer colours than everyone else. Those with typical colour vision find it difficult to understand how people with ICV perceive colour, leading to misunderstanding and challenges for people with ICV. To help improve understanding, personalized simulations of ICV have been developed, but are computationally demanding (so limited to static images), which limits the value of these simulations. To address this, we extended personalized ICV simulations to work in real time on a mobile device to allow people with typical colour vision greater freedom in exploring ICV. To validate our approach, we compared our real-time simulation technique to an existing adjustable simulation technique and found general agreement between the two. We then deployed three real-time personalized ICV simulations to nine people with typical colour vision, encouraging them to take photos of interesting colour situations. In just over one week, participants recorded over 450 real-world images of situations where their simulation presented a distinct challenge for their respective ICV participant. Through a questionnaire and discussion of photos with participants, we found that our solution provides a valuable mechanism for building understanding of ICV for people with typical colour vision.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'mobile personalized simulation, impaired colour vision, colourblindness, colour vision deficiency', 'numpages': '9', 'pages': '181â€“189', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Colour forms an essential element of day-to-day life for most people, but at least 5\\% of the world have Impaired Colour Vision (ICV) - seeing fewer colours than everyone else.

Remote Access Programs to Better Integrate Individuals with Disabilities,10.1145/2982142.2982182,"Sensory impaired individuals are at a disadvantage in accessing and processing electronic information. The first author (i.e. Thomas Hahn) is legally blind due to Albinism. In this experience report we describe challenges faced by the visually impaired and explain how remote access programs in combination with voice communication programs can be used to---at least partially---compensate for those disadvantages because they don't transmit magnification. This property is especially important to effectively train visually impaired individuals on new applications and interfaces remotely because it allows them to view exactly the same information simultaneously with their sighted trainers.Since the technical prerequisites for this information exchange, skill transfer, and knowledge acquisition approach have already been freely available for at least 7 years, but are still not widely used, this approach needs to be impressively demonstrated at conferences like this one to increase the odds that its participants will share this approach with those who could potentially benefit from it. This approach could make computer labs with expensive software not only accessible to the disabled, but instead, to everyone around the clock while saving money, which is still being spent to pay lab supervisors to keep the labs open for a few hours without losing---but instead---gaining functionality. Offering virtual remote office hours would benefit disabled and non-handicapped students and faculty alike.Providing remote access to lectures can make them available to a wider audience and thus could decrease costs for tuition. Obvious benefits of this approach for the mobility impaired and soon to be expected benefits for the hearing impaired are mentioned. Allowing faculty to remotely participate in oral exams increases choices for possible specializations. Making information more accessible to the disabled has obvious synergistic benefits for non-handicapped people alike as reflected by the importance of the concept of workforce diversification for overcoming unexpected future challenges and potential stumbling blocks.

Blind users capture a photo of an inaccessible interface with a standard marker for absolute measurements using perspective transformation. Then this image is sent to multiple crowd workers, who work in parallel to quickly label and describe elements of the interface. These labels are then used to generate 3D models for a layer of tactile and pressable buttons that fits over the original controls.

We explore the design space and feasibility of using wearable mobile device controllers to make it easier and faster for blind people to access their phones on the go by considering various form factors and on-body placements. We conducted a study with eight blind participants, where the researchers and participants interacted with design probes to design mobile device controllers that operate the screen reader on a smartphone for the following on-body placements: hip, head, hand, and wrist. Most participants preferred wrist- and hand-mounted systems as they were considered to allow for more natural and discreet interfaces. Based on our findings, we designed a smart ring controller, which allows for a small and compact form factor, and only requires one-handed interactions.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'wearable controls, mobile devices, blind, accessibility', 'numpages': '2', 'pages': '341â€“342', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Blind people get critical information from their mobile phones while traveling.

An Affordable Virtual Reality Learning Framework for Children with Neuro-Developmental Disorder,10.1145/2982142.2982143,"Our research explores wearable Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) to support new forms of intervention for children with Neuro-Developmental Disorder (NDD). In cooperation with therapists at a local rehabilitation center, we developed and evaluated Wildcard, a system that exploits a low cost VR visor and enables the child to ""feel immersed"" in 3D worlds, using eye focus and head/body movements to interact with the virtual items. Wildcard includes a set of functionalities for the therapists to monitor children's interaction, to customize the virtual space for the specific needs of each subject, and to automatically collect data.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'virtual reality, neuro-developmental disorder, accessibility', 'numpages': '2', 'pages': '343â€“344', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': 'Our research explores wearable Immersive Virtual Reality (IVR) to support new forms of intervention for children with Neuro-Developmental Disorder (NDD).

Gaze Typing Through Foot-Operated Wearable Device,10.1145/2982142.2982145,"Gaze Typing, a gaze-assisted text entry method, allows individuals with motor (arm, spine) impairments to enter text on a computer using a virtual keyboard and their gaze. Though gaze typing is widely accepted, this method is limited by its lower typing speed, higher error rate, and the resulting visual fatigue, since dwell-based key selection is used. In this research, we present a gaze-assisted, wearable-supplemented, foot interaction framework for dwell-free gaze typing. The framework consists of a custom-built virtual keyboard, an eye tracker, and a wearable device attached to the user's foot. To enter a character, the user looks at the character and selects it by pressing the pressure pad, attached to the wearable device, with the foot. Results from a preliminary user study involving two participants with motor impairments show that the participants achieved a mean gaze typing speed of 6.23 Words Per Minute (WPM). In addition, the mean value of Key Strokes Per Character (KPSC) was 1.07 (ideal 1.0), and the mean value of Rate of Backspace Activation (RBA) was 0.07 (ideal 0.0). Furthermore, we present our findings from multiple usability studies and design iterations, through which we created appropriate affordances and experience design of our gaze typing system.","{'series': ""ASSETS '16"", 'location': 'Reno, Nevada, USA', 'keywords': 'wearable devices, gaze typing, foot-operated devices', 'numpages': '2', 'pages': '345â€“346', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 18th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': ""Gaze Typing, a gaze-assisted text entry method, allows individuals with motor (arm, spine) impairments to enter text on a computer using a virtual keyboard and their gaze.

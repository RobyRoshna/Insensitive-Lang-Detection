How someone with a neuromuscular disease experiences operating a PC (and how to successfully counteract that),10.1145/2513383.2517034,"This paper describes the experiences of the first author, who has been diagnosed with the neuromuscular disease Friedreich's Ataxia more than 25 years ago, with the innovative approach to human-computer interaction characterized by the software tool OnScreenDualScribe. Originally developed by (and for!) the first author, the tool replaces the standard input devices -- i.e., keyboard and mouse -- with a small numerical keypad, making optimal use of his abilities. The paper attempts to illustrate some of the difficulties the first author usually has to face when operating a computer, due to considerable motor problems. It will be shown what he tried in the past, and why OnScreenDualScribe, offering various assistive techniques -- including word prediction, an ambiguous keyboard, and stepwise pointing operations -- is indeed a viable alternative. The ultimate goal is to help not only one single person, but to make the system -- which does not accelerate entry very much, but clearly reduces the required effort -- available to anyone with similar conditions.","{'series': ""ASSETS '13"", 'location': 'Bellevue, Washington', 'keywords': ""word prediction, neuromuscular disease, mouse emulator, keyboard replacement, human-computer interaction, dysarthria, ambiguous keyboard, Friedreich's Ataxia"", 'numpages': '6', 'articleno': '29', 'booktitle': 'Proceedings of the 15th International ACM SIGACCESS Conference on Computers and Accessibility', 'abstract': ""This paper describes the experiences of the first author, who has been diagnosed with the neuromuscular disease Friedreich's Ataxia more than 25 years ago, with the innovative approach to human-computer interaction characterized by the software tool OnScreenDualScribe.

Moreover, we devised scenarios, and built hardware and software solutions to motivate discovery and retention of Braille literacy.', 'doi': '10.1145/2513383.2513415', 'url': 'https://doi.org/10.1145/2513383.2513415', 'address': 'New York, NY, USA', 'publisher': 'Association for Computing Machinery', 'isbn': '9781450324052', 'year': '2013', 'title': 'The today and tomorrow of Braille learning', 'author': 'Guerreiro, J. and Gon\\c{c}alves, D. and Marques, D. and Guerreiro, T. and Nicolau, H. and Montague, K.', 'ENTRYTYPE': 'inproceedings', 'ID': '10.1145/2513383.2513415'}"

Uncovering the role of expectations on perceived web accessibility,10.1145/2513383.2513411,"Compliance to accessibility standards does not guarantee a satisfying user experience on the Web.

We conducted a study with 11 blind users to explore how these expectations shape the perception of web accessibility. Our preliminary findings corroborate that expectations can affect the perception of web accessibility. Additionally, we find that expectations on the Web are built up on previous experiences and prejudices.
